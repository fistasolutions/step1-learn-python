    "# Overview of Python Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Python Packages?\n",
    "A Python package is a collection of modules organized in a directory hierarchy. Packages allow for better code organization and reuse. They can include built-in, external, or custom packages, depending on their origin and purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Python Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Built-in Packages\n",
    "These are standard libraries that come pre-installed with Python. They provide essential functionalities and do not require separate installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples:\n",
    "- `os`: Provides functions for interacting with the operating system.\n",
    "- `sys`: Used to interact with the Python interpreter.\n",
    "- `math`: Contains mathematical functions like `sqrt`, `sin`, etc.\n",
    "- `datetime`: Offers classes for manipulating dates and times.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. External Packages\n",
    "External packages are third-party libraries that are not included in the standard library. They need to be installed using a package manager like `pip`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples:\n",
    "- `numpy`: Used for numerical computations.\n",
    "- `pandas`: Provides data manipulation and analysis tools.\n",
    "- `requests`: Simplifies making HTTP requests.\n",
    "- `flask`: A lightweight web framework for building web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install requests\n",
    "```\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "response = requests.get('https://api.example.com')\n",
    "print(response.status_code)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Custom Packages\n",
    "Custom packages are created by developers to organize their own code. These are typically used in projects to group related functionalities together.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "Directory Structure:\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_package/\n",
    "    __init__.py\n",
    "    module1.py\n",
    "    module2.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from my_package import module1\n",
    "module1.some_function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Key Python Package Management Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `pip`\n",
    "- Python's package installer.\n",
    "- Used to install and manage third-party libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `venv`\n",
    "- A module for creating virtual environments.\n",
    "- Helps isolate project dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `conda`\n",
    "- A package manager and environment manager.\n",
    "- Commonly used in data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Popular Python Packages and Their Uses\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Science and Analysis\n",
    "- **`numpy`**: Numerical computations.\n",
    "- **`pandas`**: Data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "- **`matplotlib`**: Data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web Development\n",
    "- **`django`**: High-level web framework.\n",
    "- **`flask`**: Lightweight web framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning\n",
    "- **`scikit-learn`**: Machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "- **`tensorflow`**: Deep learning framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Utilities\n",
    "- **`argparse`**: Command-line argument parsing.\n",
    "- **`logging`**: Logging capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of Using Packages\n",
    "1. **Code Reusability**: Write once, use multiple times.\n",
    "2. **Organization**: Helps keep code modular and easier to maintain.\n",
    "3. **Collaboration**: Standardizes project structure for team use.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Custom Package\n",
    "Steps to create a custom package:\n",
    "1. Create a directory for the package.\n",
    "2. Add an `__init__.py` file (can be empty).\n",
    "3. Add Python modules inside the directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mkdir my_package\n",
    "cd my_package\n",
    "echo \"\" > __init__.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
