    "# File Handling in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "File handling is an essential skill in Python that allows programs to read, write, and manipulate files stored on the computer. Python provides built-in functions and methods to work with files efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Opening a File\n",
    "Python uses the `open()` function to open files. The function returns a file object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open(file_path, mode)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`file_path`**: The path to the file.\n",
    "- **`mode`**: The mode in which the file is opened (default is 'r').\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modes\n",
    "| Mode | Description                     |\n",
    "|------|---------------------------------|\n",
    "| `r`  | Read (default, file must exist) |\n",
    "| `w`  | Write (creates/truncates file)  |\n",
    "| `a`  | Append (creates if not exists)  |\n",
    "| `x`  | Create (fails if exists)        |\n",
    "| `b`  | Binary mode                     |\n",
    "| `t`  | Text mode (default)             |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading Files\n",
    "### Reading the Entire File\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading Line by Line\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    for line in file:\n",
    "        print(line.strip())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading Specific Lines\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    lines = file.readlines()\n",
    "    print(lines[0])  # First line\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing to Files\n",
    "### Writing Content\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "    file.write(\"This is a new file.\\n\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Appending Content\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"a\") as file:\n",
    "    file.write(\"Adding a new line.\\n\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with Binary Files\n",
    "### Reading Binary Data\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"example.jpg\", \"rb\") as file:\n",
    "    data = file.read()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing Binary Data\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"example_copy.jpg\", \"wb\") as file:\n",
    "    file.write(data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## File Management\n",
    "### Checking if a File Exists\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "if os.path.exists(\"example.txt\"):\n",
    "    print(\"File exists.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"File does not exist.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deleting a File\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "if os.path.exists(\"example.txt\"):\n",
    "    os.remove(\"example.txt\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exception Handling in File Operations\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "        print(file.read())\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    print(\"The file does not exist.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "File handling in Python is straightforward and powerful. It is essential for tasks such as data persistence, logging, and configuration management. Remember to always close files or use the `with` statement to ensure proper resource management.\n"
