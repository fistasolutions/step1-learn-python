    "## Introduction\n",
    "Python provides several built-in data structures to organize and manage data efficiently. Each structure has unique characteristics and use cases, making Python versatile for various programming scenarios.\n",

    "## Types of Data Structures in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lists**: Ordered, mutable collections of elements.\n",
    "2. **Tuples**: Ordered, immutable collections of elements.\n",
    "3. **Dictionaries**: Unordered collections of key-value pairs.\n",
    "4. **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique elements.\n",

    "## Why Use Data Structures?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data structures help:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Store and organize data logically.\n",
    "- Enable efficient data access and manipulation.\n",
    "- Solve complex computational problems.\n",

    "### 1. Lists\n",
    "- Dynamic arrays that can hold heterogeneous data.\n",
    "- Syntax: `[1, 2, 3, \"Python\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Tuples\n",
    "- Similar to lists but immutable.\n",
    "- Syntax: `(1, 2, 3, \"Python\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Dictionaries\n",
    "- Store data as key-value pairs for fast lookups.\n",
    "- Syntax: `{\"key\": \"value\"}`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Sets\n",
    "- Collections of unique items with no order.\n",
    "- Syntax: `{1, 2, 3}`\n",

    "Each data structure serves specific purposes and scenarios. Python's flexibility with data structures makes it suitable for tasks ranging from simple scripts to complex applications.\n"
