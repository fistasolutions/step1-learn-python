# DevOps with GitHub: A Comprehensive Guide

## **Module 1: Introduction to DevOps and GitHub**

### **What is DevOps?**
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the development lifecycle while delivering high-quality software. 

#### **Key Principles of DevOps:**
1. Collaboration between teams.
2. Automation of processes.
3. Continuous Integration and Delivery.
4. Monitoring and Feedback.

#### **Example:**
Imagine a team building a weather app. With DevOps:
- Developers write code and push it to a shared repository.
- Automated tools test the code.
- Operations deploy the app automatically if tests pass.

### **What is GitHub?**
GitHub is a platform for version control and collaboration. It allows developers to work on projects together, track changes, and manage code repositories.

#### **Setting up GitHub:**
1. Create a GitHub account at [github.com](https://github.com).
2. Install Git on your local machine.
3. Configure Git with your username and email:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
   ```

### **Lab: Setting Up Your GitHub Repository**
1. **Create a Repository:**
   - Log in to GitHub and click “New Repository”.
   - Name your repository (e.g., `weather-app`).
   - Select “Public” and check “Initialize this repository with a README”.
2. **Clone the Repository Locally:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
   ```
3. **Push Code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   echo "# Weather App" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push origin main
   ```

## **Module 2: Version Control and Collaboration**

### **Advanced Git Concepts**

#### **Branching and Merging:**
Branches allow you to work on different features simultaneously.

- Create a new branch:
  ```bash
  git branch feature-login
  git checkout feature-login
  ```
- Merge the branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git merge feature-login
  ```

#### **Resolving Merge Conflicts:**
If two branches modify the same file, conflicts occur during merging.
- Open the conflicting file and edit manually.
- Mark resolved conflicts and commit:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Resolved conflicts"
  ```

#### **Example:**
1. Developer A works on `feature-login`.
2. Developer B works on `feature-signup`.
3. Both merge into `main`, resolving any conflicts.

### **Collaborative Development**
- **Pull Requests:**
  1. Create a pull request in GitHub.
  2. Add reviewers and wait for feedback.
- **GitHub Issues:**
  - Use for bug tracking or feature requests.

#### **Lab: Collaborative Project**
1. Clone a shared repository.
2. Create a branch for your feature.
3. Push changes and open a pull request.

## **Module 3: Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions**

### **What is CI/CD?**
CI/CD automates testing and deployment. Continuous Integration ensures code changes integrate seamlessly, while Continuous Delivery automates deployment.

#### **GitHub Actions Basics:**
1. **Workflow Files:** Define automation scripts in `.github/workflows/`.
   Example CI workflow:
   ```yaml
   name: CI Pipeline
   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Run Tests
           run: npm test
   ```

2. **Triggers:** Automatically start workflows based on events like `push` or `pull_request`.

### **Lab: Build and Test Automation**
1. Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
2. Define steps to test your project.
3. Push changes to trigger the workflow.

---

## **Module 4: Continuous Delivery (CD) with GitHub Actions**

### **Deploying Applications:**
1. Automate deployments to AWS, Azure, or GCP.
2. Example Deployment Workflow:
   ```yaml
   name: CD Pipeline
   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main
   jobs:
     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Deploy to AWS
           run: ./deploy-script.sh
   ```

### **Lab: CD Workflow**
1. Write a deployment script.
2. Configure a GitHub Action to run it on every merge.

---

## **Module 5: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with GitHub**

### **What is IaC?**
IaC manages infrastructure using code, enabling consistency and versioning.

#### **Example with Terraform:**
1. Install Terraform.
2. Write a configuration file:
   ```hcl
   provider "aws" {
     region = "us-west-2"
   }
   resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
     bucket = "my-unique-bucket-name"
     acl    = "private"
   }
   ```
3. Apply the configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

### **Lab: Deploy Infrastructure with IaC**
1. Use Terraform to create an AWS EC2 instance.
2. Automate the process with GitHub Actions.

---

## **Module 6: Monitoring and Feedback**

### **Monitoring in DevOps:**
1. Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for observability.
2. Set up alerts for performance issues.

#### **Example:**
Integrate monitoring tools to track application uptime and resource usage.

### **Lab: Set Up Monitoring**
1. Deploy Prometheus and Grafana.
2. Create dashboards for your application.

---

## **Module 7: Security in DevOps with GitHub**

### **GitHub Security Features:**
1. Enable Dependabot for dependency updates.
2. Use Code Scanning for vulnerability detection.

#### **Example:**
Set up CodeQL in GitHub Actions to scan your repository:
```yaml
name: CodeQL Analysis
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  analyze:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Initialize CodeQL
        uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
        with:
          languages: javascript
      - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
        uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
```

### **Lab: Implement Security Practices**
1. Enable Dependabot alerts.
2. Resolve identified vulnerabilities.

---

## **Module 8: Real-World DevOps Project**

### **Project Overview:**
1. Create an end-to-end pipeline for a sample project.
2. Include CI/CD, IaC, monitoring, and security.

#### **Lab:**
1. Build a weather app.
2. Automate testing, deployment, and monitoring.
