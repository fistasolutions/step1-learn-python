# Introduction

## What is a Computer?
A computer is an electronic device capable of processing data, performing calculations, and executing tasks based on instructions provided by software. It consists of hardware (physical components) and software (programs and operating systems) that work together to perform various operations.

### Key Features of a Computer:
- **Speed**: Executes millions of instructions per second.
- **Accuracy**: Performs precise calculations.
- **Automation**: Runs tasks without human intervention once programmed.
- **Storage**: Stores vast amounts of data.

## What is Programming?
Programming is the process of designing, writing, testing, and maintaining code to instruct a computer to perform specific tasks. It involves using programming languages like Python, Java, and C++ to create software applications.

### Why Learn Programming?
- Automate repetitive tasks.
- Solve complex problems efficiently.
- Build applications, websites, and games.
- Enhance logical and analytical thinking.

## What is High-Level and Low-Level Programming?
### High-Level Programming:
- **Definition**: Programming languages that are user-friendly and closer to human languages.
- **Examples**: Python, Java, C++.
- **Features**:
  - Easy to read and write.
  - Abstracts hardware details.
  - Portable across different platforms.

### Low-Level Programming:
- **Definition**: Programming languages that are closer to machine language and provide less abstraction.
- **Examples**: Assembly, Machine Code.
- **Features**:
  - Directly interacts with hardware.
  - Faster execution.
  - Requires detailed knowledge of hardware architecture.
