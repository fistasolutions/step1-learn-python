    "# Hello World Program\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing Your First Python Program\n",
    "The first program you typically write in any programming language is the \"Hello, World!\" program. It is a simple way to get started and ensure that your development environment is correctly set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Write \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "1. Open your Python IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook).\n",
    "2. Create a new file or notebook.\n",
    "3. Add the following line of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Run the program to see the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, World!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "## What is `print` in Python?\n",
    "The `print()` function is used to output text or data to the console. It is one of the most commonly used functions in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- **`*objects`**: The values to be printed.\n",
    "- **`sep`**: Separator between values (default is a space).\n",
    "- **`end`**: What to print at the end (default is a newline `\\n`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "print(\"Python\", \"is\", \"fun\", sep=\"-\")\n",
    "print(\"This is the end\", end=\"!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, World!\n",
    "Python-is-fun\n",
    "This is the end!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "## How to Run a Python Program\n",
    "### Running `.py` Files\n",
    "1. Open a text editor or IDE.\n",
    "2. Save your Python code in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `hello.py`).\n",
    "3. Open a terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "4. Navigate to the file's directory.\n",
    "5. Run the program using the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python hello.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Code in Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "1. Open Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "2. Create a new notebook or open an existing one.\n",
    "3. Add your Python code in a cell.\n",
    "4. Run the cell by pressing `Shift + Enter` or clicking the \"Run\" button.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Difference Between `.py` and `.ipynb`\n",
    "### `.py`\n",
    "- Plain text file containing Python code.\n",
    "- Can be executed in any Python interpreter or terminal.\n",
    "- Ideal for scripting and larger projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `.ipynb`\n",
    "- Interactive file used in Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "- Contains cells for both code and markdown (text).\n",
    "- Ideal for data analysis, visualizations, and tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation of Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents with live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "- Interactive coding environment.\n",
    "- Supports multiple languages, including Python.\n",
    "- Inline visualization with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markdown Section in Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "Markdown is used to write formatted text in Jupyter Notebook. Examples include headings, bullet points, and links.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Markdown Examples:\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "# Heading Level 1\n",
    "## Heading Level 2\n",
    "**Bold Text**\n",
    "*Italic Text*\n",
    "- Bullet Point 1\n",
    "- Bullet Point 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running a Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "1. Open Anaconda Navigator or run the command `jupyter notebook` in your terminal.\n",
    "2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create a notebook.\n",
    "3. Create a new notebook and start coding!\n"
