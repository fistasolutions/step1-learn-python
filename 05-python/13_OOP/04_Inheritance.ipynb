    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows one class (child class) to derive or inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (parent class). It promotes code reusability and logical hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Inheritance\n",
    "- **Code Reusability**: Reduces redundancy by reusing existing code.\n",
    "- **Modularity**: Helps organize code in a logical and hierarchical manner.\n",
    "- **Extensibility**: Makes it easy to extend the functionality of existing classes.\n"
